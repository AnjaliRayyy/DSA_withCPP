What Are Vectors in C++?
A vector in C++ is a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and works like a dynamic array — it can resize itself automatically when elements are added or removed.

✅ Think of it as:

    - An array that grows/shrinks on its own.

    - A container that offers many built-in functions (like push_back, sort, erase, etc.)

    - Type-safe, so it holds elements of only one data type.


Syntax:
                #include <vector>
                using namespace std;

                vector<int> v;          // Empty vector of ints
                vector<string> names;   // Vector of strings
